/*This project is completely inspired from Dr. Jonas Birch. i created for my personal use and will create my own additions to this. */

1. Move the tsbs file to your var folder using `sudo cp -R tsbs /var/`.
2. Then use `cd /var/tsbs `
3. Use `sudo mv tsbs /usr/bin/local`
4. Use `cd /usr/local/bin`
5. Then `sudo chmod +x tsbs`


 -Now you are free to use it from anywhere by just using tsbs and selecting the template.
 -If you wish to add more templates go `cd /var/tsbs/templates`
 -Create the another folder, name it as `default_project.rs` and put the templates inside this folder.
 (NOTE: While creating your own templates, name the quantities you wish to change as "PROJECTNAME"
